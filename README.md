## What is Feature Engineering ?
Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that arenâ€™t in the training set. It can produce new features for both supervised and unsupervised learning, with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy. Feature engineering is required when working with machine learning models. Regardless of the data or architecture, a terrible feature will have a direct impact on your model.
## Importance Of Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is a very important step in machine learning. Feature engineering refers to the process of designing artificial features into an algorithm. These artificial features are then used by that algorithm in order to improve its performance, or in other words reap better results. Data scientists spend most of their time with data, and it becomes important to make models accurate.
